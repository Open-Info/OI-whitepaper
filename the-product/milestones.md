# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

## Q1&#x20;

### In-house product development

During the first quarter, the focus will be on in-house product development. The Open Info movement will work on developing the infrastructure necessary to create, distribute, and verify soulbound NFTs. This will include developing smart contracts and a user-friendly interface.

## Q2&#x20;

### Public testing

The second quarter will be devoted to public testing of the soulbound-certification system. Open Info will work with a select group of beta testers to identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing. This feedback will be used to refine the verification system, ensuring that it is user-friendly and meets the needs of the community.

## Q3

### Public launch and marketing

The third quarter will see the official launch of the dApp, namely VRFD. The verification and flagging systems will be made available to the public, and the project will begin accepting applications for verification, flagging, and official certification. During this time, the project will also work to raise awareness of its mission and benefits thereof.

## Q4

### Gather data and develop AI

In the fourth quarter, the Open Info movement will focus on gathering data and developing the AI model. Open Info will analyze the effectiveness of the system, this includes all collected data from the Soulbound NFTs as well as feedback from our users.&#x20;

Once enough data has been accumulated, Open Info will continue developing algorithms and machine learning models that can identify patterns and anomalies in the data, flagging potential fraud and corruption. The goal is to make the flagging system more efficient and effective, providing greater transparency and accountability to the community, whilst remaining scalable.
