## Features

VRFD is a decentralized web3 integrated App that allows users to:

1. Register and verify themselves by linking their social identities and/or other publicly available information to their Ethereum address.
2. Report other Ethereum addresses for acting in a manner that is malicious towards others; provided proof is supplied.
3. Openly query and validate the status (i.e. verified or flagged) of any given Ethereum address.

## Monetization

* Verification and querying of any address will forever be free to use.&#x20;
* Certification is available at a varying fee depending on the scale.
* Successful reports of unidentified addresses give verified users a chance of earning a bounty reward.

## Backend

All classifications are issued by minting a Soulbound NFT to the given address. This makes the given status of any address openly verifiable on the blockchain.

The following page provides a detailed description of the Soulbound NFTs pioneered by Open Info.
