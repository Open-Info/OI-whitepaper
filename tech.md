# Soulbound NFTs

## What are our Soulbound NFT standards?

The Soulbound non-fungible token (NFT) is a unique digital asset that is used by the Open Information movement for certification, verifying information, and flagging malicious actors. It is a specialized type of NFT that is designed to be tamper-proof and resistant to forgery, making it ideal for use in situations where trust and verification are critical.

The use case for Soulbound NFTs is broad and includes areas such as education, finance, healthcare, and politics. For example, a university might use Soulbound NFTs to certify the completion of a degree program, ensuring that the information is accurate and trustworthy. Similarly, a bank might use Soulbound NFTs to verify the identity of its customers, preventing fraud and money laundering.

## `ERC-721`

To ensure the interoperability of Soulbound NFTs across different platforms and ecosystems, the Open Information movement has adopted the ERC-721 standard. This is a widely used standard for non-fungible tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, and it provides a set of guidelines and rules for creating and managing NFTs.

By using the ERC-721 standard, Soulbound NFTs can be easily exchanged, bought, and sold on decentralized exchanges, creating a liquid market for these unique digital assets. In addition, the use of the standard ensures that Soulbound NFTs can be integrated with other applications and platforms that support ERC-721 tokens, expanding their usefulness and potential applications.

Overall, the use of Soulbound NFTs and the ERC-721 standard represents a powerful combination of technology and innovation that has the potential to transform how we verify information and establish trust in our digital world. By leveraging the unique properties of blockchain and NFTs, the&#x20;
