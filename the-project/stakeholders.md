# üåç Stakeholders

Within Open Info (Pty) Ltd, the registered employees primarily constitute the core team responsible for the day-to-day operations, _management_, and implementation of VRFD. As employees of the registered entity, they are entrusted with specific roles and responsibilities pertaining to VRFD's development and execution.

Individuals who purchase and hold Open Info Tokens are recognized as shareholders within the ecosystem. The ownership and possession of the Open Info Token grant these individuals the status of shareholders, enabling them to participate actively in the governance and decision-making processes of VRFD. This inclusive approach fosters a decentralized decision-making structure where the interests and perspectives of token holders are considered.
