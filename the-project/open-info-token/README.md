# ðŸª™ Open Info Token

Open Info Token, OIT, is the governance and utility token of VRFD.

{% hint style="danger" %}
OIT is not sold by Open Info, its liquidity is decentrally funded and obtainable via UniSwap.
{% endhint %}

## Purpose

Open Info depends on high-quality, large-scale data to function efficiently. OIT motivates users to contribute to VRFD by creating data and/or reviewing data. These contributions help to improve the quality and quantity of VRFD's dataset.

{% hint style="info" %}
OIT enables the Core Team to operate VRFD in a decentralized manner, with no central authority making product decisions.
{% endhint %}

Therefore, OIT serves to prevent the principal-agent dilemma. This dilemma arises when an agent of an organization makes decisions on behalf of another person or entity within the organization, which could have a negative impact on that person or entity. This dilemma typically occurs when an agent acts in his or her own self-interest rather than in the best interests of the organization.
