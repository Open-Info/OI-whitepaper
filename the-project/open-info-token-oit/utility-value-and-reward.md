# Utility, value & reward

## Utility

The OIT token serves as a fundamental utility within the Open Info ecosystem, providing stakeholders with governance rights through decision-making power. Stakeholders consist of the core team and shareholders (token holders). This structure resembles an assembly-type DAO where a large number of members interact in decision-making with an agency via smart contracts.&#x20;

By holding OIT tokens, stakeholders gain voting rights, allowing them to propose and vote on important matters such as project upgrades, resource allocation, and strategic initiatives. This decentralized governance approach ensures that decisions are made collectively, minimizing the principal-agent dilemma and empowering stakeholders to shape the future of Open Info.&#x20;

## Value

Staking OIT provides access to premium features across all products developed by Open Info, unlocking enhanced functionalities and capabilities. These premium features include privileged access to CTRFD status, granting users exclusive benefits and insights related to wallet health.

While premium features are available through OIT, it is important to note that all products within the ecosystem will always offer a base tier that is free to use. This base tier ensures that users have access to essential services and functionalities without any cost.

* For VRFD, the base tier includes openly searching data, enabling users to retrieve information without limitations.
* For Wallet Health, the base tier allows users to view the number of potential insecurities within their wallets.

By offering a combination of premium features and a free-to-use base tier, Open Info aims to cater to the diverse needs of its users while maintaining accessibility and value for all participants within the ecosystem.

## Reward

Beyond governance, the OIT token also serves as a reward mechanism within the ecosystem. Token holders can earn rewards in the form of OIT tokens for their active participation, contribution, and positive impact on Open Info. These rewards incentivize stakeholders to actively engage with the platform, contribute their expertise, and drive the growth and success of the ecosystem. With a strong focus on transparency and decentralized decision-making, the utility of the OIT token not only aligns the interests of stakeholders but also fosters a vibrant and collaborative community-driven ecosystem.

Positive feedback loops are established within the ecosystem to align incentives and drive active participation, fostering a vibrant and engaged community. Rewards are provided to users who actively engage with the ecosystem in various ways. This includes:

* participating in governance processes, where users have the opportunity to shape the direction of the project.&#x20;
* active involvement in the incubation of any products, from testing to utilizing.
* contributions to the quantity and quality of data are also incentivized and rewarded.

By incorporating airdrops and bounties as specific reward mechanisms, Open Info encourages and acknowledges the valuable contributions made by its community members, fostering a dynamic ecosystem where participation, engagement, and collaboration are key drivers of growth and success.
