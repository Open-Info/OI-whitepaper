# ðŸª™ Open Info Token (OIT)

Open Info Token (OIT) is the governance token distributed to the community through Open Info. The different ways in which OIT can be obtained and utilised are explained here. Each OIT represents one governance voting right in proposals put forth for the Core Team to execute. The tokenomics of OIT will also be discussed. OIT enables the Core Team to operate Open Info in a decentralized manner, with no central authority making decisions regarding any actions or products. Participating OIT users will receive incentives for their input into the project. Future uses cases for OIT will also be touched on.

## Purpose

Open Info depends on high-quality, large-scale data to function efficiently. OIT finances the development and marketing of the products incubated by the Core Team. OIT motivates users to contribute to Open Info by creating data and/or reviewing data. These contributions help to improve the quality and quantity of Open Info's data, which in turn makes Open Info more effective.&#x20;

In addition, OIT serves to prevent the principal-agent dilemma. This dilemma arises when an agent of an organization makes decisions on behalf of another person or entity within the organization, which could have a negative impact on that person or entity. This dilemma typically occurs when an agent acts in his or her own self-interest rather than in the best interests of the organization.
