Airdrop and bounty allocations are released uniformly over the course of 5 years. The block rates for staking rewards will be varied to maintain a sustainable release rate, drying up after roughly 5 to 10 years. Favourable APRs are estimated at 20% to 30% and doubled for LP token stakers.

### Standard&#x20;

Standard ERC20 but one modification, no burning function. Ownership will be renounced.
