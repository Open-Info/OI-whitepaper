# ðŸ—³ Voting

## AI reinforcement

The Soulbound non-fungible token (NFT) given by the Open Information movement can be used as a voting system to record the reputation of a given address. This means that users can vote on the accuracy and validity of the information presented on the platform, and the AI system can learn from these votes to improve its accuracy over time.

To implement this system, the Open Information movement will create a system that links the Soulbound NFT to a voting system. When a user interacts with a piece of certified information, they would be given the option to vote on its accuracy or validity. Their vote would be validated on the blockchain, and the AI system would use this data to learn and adjust its algorithms.

Over time, as more users interact with the system and vote on certified information, the AI system will become increasingly accurate and reliable. This will create a positive feedback loop, where users are incentivized to interact with the platform and provide feedback, and the AI system is incentivized to improve its accuracy based on this feedback.

Overall, the use of Soulbound NFTs as a voting system to train the AI represents an innovative approach to creating a more transparent, accountable, and trustworthy platform. By empowering users to provide feedback and incentivizing the AI system to learn and improve, the Open Information movement is laying the groundwork for a more equitable and reliable digital ecosystem.
