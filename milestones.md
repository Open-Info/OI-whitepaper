# ðŸ›£ Roadmap

### Q1 (January-March): In-house product development

During the first quarter, the focus will be on in-house product development. The Open Information movement will work on developing the infrastructure necessary to create, distribute, and verify soulbound NFTs. This will include developing smart contracts and a user-friendly interface.

### Q2 (April-June): Public testing

The second quarter will be devoted to public testing of the certification system. The Open Information movement will work with a select group of beta testers to identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing. This feedback will be used to refine the verification system, ensuring that it is user-friendly and meets the needs of the community.

### Q3 (July-September):Public aunch and marketing

The third quarter will see the official launch of the OI-VRFD App. The verification and flagging systems will be made available to the public, and the project will begin accepting applications for verification, flagging, and official certification. During this time, the project will also work to raise awareness of its mission and benefits thereof.

### Q4 (October-December): Gather data and develop AI

In the fourth quarter, the Open Information movement will focus on gathering data and developing the AI custodian. Open Information will analyze the effectiveness of the system, this includes all collected data from the soulbound NFTs as well as feedback from our users.&#x20;

Once enough data has been accumalted, Open Information will begin exploring the use of AI for verification and flagging. This will involve developing algorithms and machine learning models that can identify patterns and anomalies in the data, flagging potential fraud and corruption. The goal is to make the verification system more efficient and effective, providing greater transparency and accountability to the community, whilst remaining scalable.
