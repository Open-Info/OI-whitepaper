# Milestones

### Q1 (January-March): In-house product development

During the first quarter, the focus will be on in-house product development. The Open Information movement will work on developing the infrastructure necessary to create, distribute, and verify Soulbound NFTs. This will include developing smart contracts and a user-friendly interface for creating and distributing certifications.

### Q2 (April-June): Public testing

The second quarter will be devoted to public testing of the certification system. The Open Information movement will work with a select group of beta testers to identify and fix any bugs or issues that arise during testing. This feedback will be used to refine the certification system, ensuring that it is user-friendly and meets the needs of the community.

### Q3 (July-September): Launch

The third quarter will see the official launch of the Open Information VRFD App. The certification system will be made available to the public, and the movement will begin accepting applications for certification. During this time, the movement will also work to raise awareness of its mission and the benefits of certification.

### Q4 (October-December): Gather data and develop AI

In the fourth quarter, the Open Information movement will focus on gathering data and developing AI. The movement will collect data on the use of Soulbound NFTs for certification, including feedback from users and data on the effectiveness of the system. This data will be used to refine the system and improve its accuracy.&#x20;

In addition, the movement will begin exploring the use of AI for certification and flagging malicious actors. This will involve developing algorithms and machine learning models that can identify patterns and anomalies in the data, flagging potential fraud and corruption. The goal is to make the certification system more efficient and effective, providing greater transparency and accountability to the community.
