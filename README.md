# â„¹ Opening Words

We are pleased to introduce you to our latest project, Open Info. In today's world, trust is a valuable commodity and unfortunately it's becoming harder and harder to come by. With the rise of digital assets, it's more important than ever to have a way to verify the integrity of those with whom we transact, without compromising anonymity. The goal of Open Info is to establish a safer space for the users of Ethereum.\
\
Our first product, VRFD, enhances Ethereum with a reputation system based on verifiable and transparent data. We have created a system where users can easily verify the integrity of anonymous parties on the Ethereum network. Once a soulbound NFT for verification is issued, our users can quickly and transparently assert the identity of a given Ethereum or Layer 2 Address. Furthermore, users can directly influence the reputation of an address. Any addresses found or reported to act maliciously are issued with an alternative soulbound NFT for flagging, making it easy for other users to identify and avoid these fraudulent actors.

What sets Open Info apart is our centralized caching system that builds and saves the network of soulbound NFTs in an extensive graphing database. This system mirrors the decentralized source of truth but offers much more significant data bandwidth in real-time. This large amount of data will allow us to train an AI model that can prematurely identify malicious addresses through their transaction patterns.  The duty of Open Info is to ensure that this takes place only under the circumstance that it is beneficial to everyone and will not cause any harm.

We welcome any contributions to our project, whether it's through financial support or simply spreading the word. Thank you for your time and consideration. If you are interested, please continue reading.

Sincerely,

The Open Info Team
