## What is Open Information?

We are excited to share with you Open Information(**OI**), a collective effort to bring about a world where information is free, accessible, and transparent. The movement aims to exist for the benefit of all. OI empowers individuals and communities to access knowledge, verify information, and collaborate effectively.\
\
OI is changing the way we verify information through the use of <mark style="color:blue;">Soulbound NFTs</mark> for <mark style="color:green;">certification</mark> and <mark style="color:red;">flagging</mark>.

{% hint style="info" %}
<mark style="color:blue;">Soulbound NFTs</mark> are irrefutable, they can always be openly verified on the blockchain. They are unique and cannot be duplicated or transferred.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

#### Certification and Flagging

OI <mark style="color:green;">certifies</mark> individuals, organizations, and businesses that have met specific criteria. OI also tracks and monitors individuals or organizations through their interaction patterns with other addresses. Those that have been (inter)acting maliciously, are <mark style="color:red;">flagged</mark>. Once an address is flagged with the <mark style="color:blue;">Soulbound NFT</mark>, it cannot get rid of it. This feature helps to prevent fraud and corruption in various fields, including education, finance, and politics.&#x20;

#### Goal

Ultimately, assembling the greater network of interactions will be used to train an AI algorithim to predictively and in a decentralised manner, act as custodian for the verification and flagging of the information. The duty of OI is to ensure that this takes place only under the circumstance that it is beneficial to everyone and will not cause any harm.

## Whitepaper breakdown

To better understand OI, this whitepaper has been created to outline its purpose, goals, and methodology.
