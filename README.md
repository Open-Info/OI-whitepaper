# â„¹ Introduction

I am pleased to introduce you to our latest project, Open Information. In today's world, trust is a valuable commodity, and unfortunately, it's becoming harder and harder to come by. With the rise of digital assets, it's more important than ever to have a way to verify the identity of those with whom we transact. That's where Open Information comes in.

Our goal with Open Information is to establish a reputation system that is based on verifiable and transparent data. We want to create a system where users can easily verify the identity of others and track their interactions on the Ethereum network. By using soulbound NFTs, we can quickly and transparently verify the identity of Ethereum public keys, and save the reputation of the owner's interactions for future reference. Furthermore, any addresses found to act unlawfully will be flagged, making it easier for other users to avoid fraudulent actors.

What sets Open Info apart is our centralized caching system that builds and saves the network of Soulbound NFTs in a large graphing database. This system mirrors the decentralized source of truth but offers much greater data bandwidth in real time. This large amount of data will allow us to train an AI model that can take over as a custodian for verification <mark style="color:green;"></mark> and flagging, in a decentralised manner.  The duty of Open Info is to ensure that this takes place only under the circumstance that it is beneficial to everyone and will not cause any harm.

By establishing a transparent and verifiable reputation system, we can increase trust in the network and improve the overall security of the ecosystem. We are confident that our project will have a significant impact on the Ethereum community, and we hope that you will consider supporting our efforts.

We welcome any contributions to our project, whether it's through financial support or simply spreading the word. Together, we can build a more secure and trustworthy Ethereum network that benefits us all.

Thank you for your time and consideration. If you are interested, please continue reading.

Sincerley,

The OpenInfo Team
